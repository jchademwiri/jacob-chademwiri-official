To effectively develop the GreenDesign Portfolio as an enterprise application, I recommend prioritizing these documents in this order:

### Immediate Priority (You already have some of these)

1. Vision and Scope Document
2. Business Requirements Document
3. UI Design System
4. Database Design Document
5. API Specifications
6. Security Requirements Document

### Secondary Priority

7. Coding Standards and Guidelines
8. Development Workflow Document
9. Project Management Plan
10. Test Strategy and Test Plan

This comprehensive documentation suite will ensure your portfolio website is developed with the same rigor and structure as enterprise software, leading to a more maintainable, scalable, and professional result.
