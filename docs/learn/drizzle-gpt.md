## 🧠 **Drizzle ORM Learning Guide**

### 🔰 **Phase 1: Get Familiar with the Basics**

> **Goal:** Understand Drizzle’s philosophy, setup, and how it maps to SQL

#### ✅ Topics to Cover:

- What is Drizzle ORM?
- Differences from Prisma / Sequelize
- Drizzle’s Relational Query Builder (RQB)
- SQL-first, typesafe design

#### 📚 Resources:

- 🔗 [Drizzle ORM Docs - Intro](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/introduction)
- 🔗 [Drizzle vs Others](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/why)

#### 🛠️ Hands-on:

1. Create a new Next.js or Node project.

2. Install Drizzle:

   ```bash
   npm i drizzle-orm
   npm i -D drizzle-kit
   ```

3. Connect to a Postgres DB (e.g. via Supabase or local Postgres)

4. Define a basic schema (`schema.ts`)

   ```ts
   import { pgTable, serial, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

   export const posts = pgTable('posts', {
     id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
     title: text('title').notNull(),
   });
   ```

5. Generate drizzle config + types:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   ```

### ⚙️ **Phase 2: Core Querying with Drizzle ORM**

> **Goal:** Learn how to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with SQL-style control

#### ✅ Topics to Cover:

- `.select().from(...)`
- `where`, `and`, `or`, `eq`, `ilike`, `between`, `gt`, `lt`, etc.
- `insert`, `update`, `delete`
- `.innerJoin()` and `.leftJoin()`

#### 📚 Resources:

- 🔗 [Drizzle Query Builder](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select)
- 🔗 [Drizzle Conditions](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/where)

#### 🛠️ Exercises:

- Insert new posts
- Search posts by title (case-insensitive)
- Update a post's title
- Delete by ID
- Fetch with joins (e.g., posts with authors)

---

### 🧱 **Phase 3: Schema Modelling + Migrations**

> **Goal:** Create and manage schema in a version-controlled way

#### ✅ Topics to Cover:

- Defining tables with `pgTable`
- Migrations with `drizzle-kit`
- Running and managing schema updates

#### 📚 Resources:

- 🔗 [Defining Schema](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/schema)
- 🔗 [Drizzle Kit CLI](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/cli)

#### 🛠️ Hands-on:

- Create multiple tables: `users`, `posts`, `comments`
- Add foreign key relations
- Run and apply migrations

  ```bash
  npx drizzle-kit push
  ```

---

### 🧰 **Phase 4: Integration with Your App**

> **Goal:** Use Drizzle in a full-stack workflow (e.g. Next.js + Supabase)

#### ✅ Topics to Cover:

- Connecting via a pool or single connection
- Querying in route handlers or API routes
- Handling edge runtime compatibility (e.g., in Vercel)

#### 📚 Resources:

- 🔗 [Next.js + Drizzle + Supabase guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#using-drizzle-orm-with-supabase)
- Sample repo: [vercel/drizzle-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/storage/drizzle-next-app)

#### 🛠️ Projects:

- Build a simple blog: CRUD for posts
- Use Drizzle + Supabase Auth
- Deploy to Vercel

---

### 📦 **Phase 5: Advanced Topics**

> **Goal:** Use Drizzle like a pro

#### ✅ Topics:

- Custom SQL with `.sql` template tags
- Transaction handling
- Enum and JSON columns
- Views, Indexes
- Composable queries

#### 📚 Resources:

- 🔗 [Advanced Queries](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql)
- 🔗 [Transactions](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/transactions)
- 🔗 [Raw SQL](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql#raw-sql)

#### 🛠️ Deep Dives:

- Paginated filtering with dynamic search
- Analytics dashboard with aggregate queries
- Admin panel with nested joins

---

### 🧪 **Phase 6: Test and Maintain**

> **Goal:** Ensure your Drizzle queries are testable and safe

#### ✅ Topics:

- Mocking DB in tests
- Type inference and safety
- Writing seeders

#### 📚 Resources:

- Your test framework (Vitest, Jest) + Supabase local
- Use `.inferModel<typeof posts>` for type-safe code
