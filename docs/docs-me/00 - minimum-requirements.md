# Streamlined Documentation for Solo Developer Portfolio Project

You're right - the full enterprise documentation suite is excessive for a solo developer. Let&apos;s create a more practical, streamlined documentation approach that still maintains professional standards while being manageable for one person.

## Essential Documentation for Solo Portfolio Development

### 1. **Project Brief & Requirements**

- Combines vision, scope, and core requirements
- Business objectives and target audience
- Success criteria and key features
- Technical constraints and assumptions
- ✓ _You already have much of this in your PRD_

### 2. **Technical Specification Light**

- Simplified architecture overview
- Technology stack with justifications
- Development approach and patterns
- ✓ _You already have this in your Technical Spec_

### 3. **Design System Documentation**

- Color palette, typography, and spacing rules
- Component library specifications
- Responsive design breakpoints
- UI patterns and reusable elements
- Visual examples/references for consistency

### 4. **Database Schema & API Documentation**

- Entity relationship diagram
- Table structure and relationships
- API endpoints and expected responses
- Authentication approach
- Data validation rules

### 5. **Development Workflow Guide**

- Git workflow (branching strategy, commit conventions)
- Local development setup instructions
- Testing approach (what and how you'll test)
- Deployment process
- Feature prioritization strategy

### 6. **Content Structure Plan**

- Content types and their attributes
- Admin workflows for content creation
- Content organization strategy
- SEO approach for different content types

### 7. **Testing Checklist**

- Critical user flows to test
- Browser/device testing matrix (which you'll support)
- Accessibility testing checklist
- Performance testing benchmarks
- Security testing items

### 8. **Maintenance Plan**

- Backup strategy
- Update/patch management approach
- Performance monitoring plan
- Content refresh schedule
- Technical debt tracking method

## Documentation Templates

```

### Database Schema & API Documentation Template

```markdown
# Database & API Documentation

## Database Schema

[Include simple ERD diagram]

### Tables

- users
  - [list fields with types and constraints]
- projects
  - [list fields with types and constraints]
- blog_posts
  - [list fields with types and constraints]
- [other tables...]

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout endpoint

### Projects

- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:slug` - Get single project
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project (authenticated)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (authenticated)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (authenticated)

### Blog Posts

- [similar structure to projects]

### Media

- [endpoints for media management]
```

### Development Workflow Guide Template

```markdown
# Development Workflow

## Local Development

1. Setup instructions
2. Environment variables
3. Running locally
4. Local testing process

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: production code
- Development branch: work in progress
- Feature branches: naming convention `feature/feature-name`
- Commit message format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Deployment Process

1. Pre-deployment checklist
2. Deployment commands/procedure
3. Post-deployment verification
4. Rollback procedure if needed

## Feature Development Process

1. Requirement clarification
2. Design/solution
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
```

```

## Documentation Maintenance Strategy

As a solo developer, maintaining documentation while developing can be challenging. Here's a pragmatic approach:

1. **Start with minimal viable documentation** - just enough to guide your development
2. **Update as you build** - set aside 15 minutes at the end of each coding session to update documentation
3. **Use documentation as planning** - write your documentation before implementing features
4. **Maintain a "tech debt" list** - note documentation gaps to fill later
5. **Automate where possible** - use tools like TypeScript for self-documenting code, JSDoc for function documentation, and database schema generators

This streamlined approach gives you professional-quality documentation that's actually manageable for a solo developer while maintaining the structure needed for an organized, maintainable project.
