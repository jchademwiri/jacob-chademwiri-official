# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating Supabase Storage with a Next.js 14+ application using Drizzle ORM. The system will provide comprehensive file upload, storage, and management capabilities with proper authentication, authorization, and performance optimization. The integration will support multiple file types, track metadata in a PostgreSQL database, and implement security best practices for production use.

2. WHEN uploading a file THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress tracking with upload status
3. WHEN uploading multiple files THEN the system SHALL support batch upload operations with individual progress indicators
4. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL validate and reject the upload with appropriate feedback
6. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL implement proper validation and sanitization for security

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an application user, I want to browse, preview, and manage my uploaded files, so that I can organize and access my content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing files THEN the system SHALL provide a file browser/gallery component with thumbnail previews
2. WHEN managing files THEN the system SHALL support delete, rename, and organize operations
3. WHEN viewing images THEN the system SHALL provide optimized preview and resizing capabilities
4. WHEN browsing large file collections THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading for performance
5. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL support folder/category structures
6. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL generate secure, time-limited URLs for file access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive server actions for file operations, so that I can integrate file management into various parts of the application with type safety and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating server actions THEN the system SHALL provide actions for file upload, metadata CRUD operations, and file deletion
2. WHEN handling server action requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling patterns with typed error responses
3. WHEN performing batch operations THEN the system SHALL support multiple file operations in single server actions
4. WHEN deleting files THEN the system SHALL remove both storage files and database metadata atomically
5. WHEN executing server actions THEN the system SHALL implement proper validation and authorization
6. WHEN server action errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed typed error responses with actionable information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security and authentication controls, so that file access is properly controlled and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication integration
2. WHEN determining file access THEN the system SHALL enforce file access permissions based on user roles
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL validate file types and content for security threats
4. WHEN generating file URLs THEN the system SHALL create secure, time-limited access URLs
5. WHEN implementing RLS THEN the system SHALL configure Row Level Security policies for data protection
6. WHEN handling sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance and scalability, so that the system can handle thousands of files per user efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading file lists THEN the system SHALL implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
2. WHEN handling images THEN the system SHALL provide automatic compression and optimization
3. WHEN querying file metadata THEN the system SHALL use proper database indexing for fast retrieval
4. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL leverage CDN capabilities for global distribution
5. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination strategies
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want server actions with proper form handling, so that I can create seamless user experiences with progressive enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing server actions THEN the system SHALL support both JavaScript-enabled and disabled environments
2. WHEN handling form submissions THEN the system SHALL provide proper validation and error handling
3. WHEN processing file uploads THEN the system SHALL use server actions with FormData handling
4. WHEN updating UI state THEN the system SHALL provide optimistic updates and proper loading states
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return typed error responses that components can handle gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling patterns across all components
2. WHEN uploads fail THEN the system SHALL provide upload failure recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL implement logging and monitoring setup for operational visibility
4. WHEN users encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear user feedback mechanisms
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL log sufficient information for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mobile and accessibility support, so that the file management system works across all devices and user needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize file upload components for mobile interfaces
2. WHEN implementing accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure file upload components meet WCAG guidelines
3. WHEN handling offline scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation for server actions
4. WHEN designing responsive interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide optimal user experience across device sizes
